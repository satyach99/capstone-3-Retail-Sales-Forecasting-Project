# capstone-3-Retail-Sales-Forecasting-Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a predictive model to accurately forecast total sales in a retail environment using transactional data. The main goal is to identify the most accurate model for this purpose.

## Models Evaluated
- **Linear Regression**
- **Random Forest**
- **Gradient Boosting**

The models are compared based on their performance, specifically looking at the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) metric.

## Results
The Random Forest model demonstrated superior performance with the lowest RMSE, making it the recommended model for deployment.

## Repository Contents
- `Capstone-3_Data_wrangling.ipynb` - Jupyter notebook containing all the code and analysis.
- `Model_Metrics_Summary.csv` - Summary of the models' performance metrics.
- `Project_Report.pdf` - Comprehensive report detailing the project's methodology, results, and recommendations.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed, or use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) to open the notebook.
3. Run the notebook `Capstone-3_Data_wrangling.ipynb` to view the analysis and model evaluations.

## Recommendations
Based on the findings, several recommendations are provided for the deployment of the Random Forest model to enhance inventory decisions and overall business strategy.

## Further Research
Further exploration into feature engineering and the inclusion of additional data sources could potentially improve the model's predictive accuracy.
